# INFO
This project allows you to search for pokemon and see information about them after you click on a result. It currently shows Name, ID, type, stats, and abilities.

## Planned features
- filtering results by type
- allow searching for all pokemon of a specific type (or more types at the same time)
- improve search to fetch results like "pikachu" from search terms like "achu" (currently it only shows "pikachu" if the search terms starts with "pi" or the rest of the letters)
- Make a mobile-friendly layout
- Make pokemon info section better-looking and more readable
- Fix pokemon info column height
- Add evolution chains
- Improve UX by making it clear what each piece of information on a pokemon is
- Improve UX by making the search functionality happen after the user has stopped typing and not just after pressing enter or leaving the search window
